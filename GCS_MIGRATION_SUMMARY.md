# AWS S3 to Google Cloud Storage Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the file upload API from AWS S3 to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) while maintaining the same presigned URL functionality and API interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies
- **Added**: `@google-cloud/storage` using pnpm
- **Kept**: AWS SDK dependencies for backward compatibility

### 2. Service Updates (`src/s3/s3.service.ts`)
- Replaced AWS S3Client with Google Cloud Storage client
- Updated authentication to use GCP service account or default credentials
- Modified presigned URL generation to use GCS v4 signed URLs
- Updated error handling and logging
- Changed public URL format to GCS format

### 3. Environment Variables
Updated `env.example` with new GCP configuration:
```env
# Google Cloud Storage Configuration
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
GCS_BUCKET_NAME=your-gcs-bucket-name
GCP_KEY_FILE=path/to/your/service-account-key.json
```

### 4. API Documentation Updates
- Updated Swagger documentation to reflect GCS instead of S3
- Changed descriptions from "S3" to "GCS" in API responses
- Updated instruction text for users

## Key Features Maintained
- ✅ Presigned upload URLs with expiration
- ✅ Presigned download URLs with expiration  
- ✅ File validation (type and size)
- ✅ User-specific folder organization
- ✅ Metadata support (original filename, upload timestamp)
- ✅ Same API interface and response format
- ✅ JWT authentication requirement

## Authentication Options
The service supports multiple GCP authentication methods:
1. **Service Account Key File**: Set `GCP_KEY_FILE` environment variable
2. **Default Credentials**: Use environment default (e.g., metadata server, gcloud CLI)
3. **Environment Variables**: Use `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

## API Endpoints (Unchanged)
- `POST /api/s3/presigned-upload-url` - Generate upload URL
- `POST /api/s3/presigned-download-url` - Generate download URL

## Testing
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ All TypeScript types are correct
- ✅ Linting passes
- ✅ API interface remains unchanged

## Next Steps
1. Set up GCP project and storage bucket
2. Create service account with Storage Admin permissions
3. Update environment variables with real GCP credentials
4. Test with actual file uploads/downloads
